        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I’m still building more confidence in backend integration, debugging complex state logic, and writing fully optimized, reusable React components.

          Keep going, even when things get tough. Every bug fixed and every new concept learned brings you one step closer to being the developer you’ve always wanted to be.
